    h1 Case of the Mondays?#[br]Never Again.
    
    p In an attempt to balance the ol’ work/life scale, HQ started, what we like to call, “Work from Home Mondays”. It’s kind of a complicated concept so allow us to explain in six easy steps:
    p.steps
      | #[b Step 1] Monday happens #[br]
      | #[b Step 2] You roll out of bed #[br]
      | #[b Step 3] Put on your HQ embroidered Snuggie #[br]
      | #[b Step 4] Pull out your Laptop #[br]
      | #[b Step 5] Work, Work, Work, Break, Work, Nap?, Work, Work #[br]
      | #[b Step 6] Look at you! You’ve just avoided a case of the Mondays

    h1 Feng Shui on Fleek
    
    p On fleek? Is this what the youths are saying now? Nevermind, we’ll ask our interns. Our office is located in the heart of downtown Ogden at Startup Ogden. In a past life our buildling was home to “Mountain States Implement Company”, a farm supply store for acient Ogdenites. It’s now home to an growing entreprenurial design and development community. The open concept lends itself to collaboration and the exposed brick and distressed hardwood floors are a homage to Ogden’s rich history.

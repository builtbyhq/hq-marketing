    p(class="text-wide") We designed and developed a new website for Gym Jones, a tight knit fitness community that conducts their teachings out of an unassuming gym in Salt Lake City. The website needed to be an online home for all of their users, not just those worthy of worshipping in their headquarters. #[a(href="http://gymjones.com", target="_blank", class="gymred") View the live site.]

            p One of the important parts of the new site was to keep online members connected with the physical Gym Jones location in Salt Lake City. A newsfeed was created to keep members up to date on the (several) daily workouts. These daily workouts include written paragraphs, and hi-definition video.

            h3 Cult Thinking
            p We wanted to keep the cult like feel to the new site without going over the top. We stripped away decorations, and “styling” to give the site a minimal feel. The physical Gym Jones location has this same intention. There are no chairs, tv’s, or any comfortable places to sit. The gym is their church, temple, and a sanctuary for fitness. Free of distractions.

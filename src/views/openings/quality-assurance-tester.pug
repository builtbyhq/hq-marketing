    In order to build great products, we have to know where they fail. Our testers aren’t expected to fix anything; just to help us find what can be improved. 

    Being comfortable with computers is and websites is important. Experience with design and/or development is a plus, but honestly, attention to detail is the biggest qualifier for this position. 

    ## SOME WAYS WE TEST

    * Comparing prototypes to original designs
    * Actively trying to break websites & apps
    * Communicating with designers, developers, and clients about intended features

    This job is easily doable from home and is typically not time sensitive.

    p(class="text-wide") Our development team has several focuses:
    p(class="text-wide") 
      | #[b Integrated design and development.] Our designers and developers work side by side to create pixel perfect results. Our developers care about the details and play well with designers. We build your product from start to finish or integrate with your team. #[br] #[br]
      | #[b Clean, readable code.] That means you're not handcuffed to us if you need to bring on new developers. It means anyone from our team, yours, or another party can jump right in. #[br] #[br]
      | #[b Thoughtful structure.] We've dealt with code that resembles Frankenstein's monster. Features and plugins bolted on with no regard to consistency. In many cases, its cheaper to start from scratch rather than fix. We pride ourselves in code structure that is flexible and sustainable.

      | We love mobile development. We build native apps for iPhone and Android (sorry Microsoft) that integrate with complex web backends. We also have experience with hybrid web app development when that route is deemed best. #[br] #[br]
      | We are proficient with Objective C (iOS) and Java (Android) and like our web development team, we work closely with the design team to ensure the entire experience is great.

    p(class="text-wide") User experience design (UX design, for short) is how a user feels about a product or company. Is she happy? Impressed? Pleasantly surprised? Or is she frustrated and confused? UX design is important for websites, web applications and mobile apps. #[br] #[br]
      | At it's core, UI/UX design involves planning and executing design in a way that results in achieving users' goals and desired feeling’s associated with that product or task. #[br] #[br]
      | Even though design should be beautiful, it should accomplish goals . That might be to increase conversions, teach a user through on boarding, or guide them to accomplish a task. Every design decision should be informed by goals. #[br] #[br]
      | So how do we design a great user experience? #[a(href="https://builtbyhq.com/blog/our-design-process", target="_blank") See our process.] In short, it involves research: determining goals, creating user profiles, listing use cases, and mapping all screens. After wireframes and full designs come iteration and testing. Take a look at our design portfolio on #[a(href="https://dribbble.com/builtbyhq", target="_blank") Dribbble.]

    p(class="text-wide") #[br] Your brand is your company's image. It’s how your customers perceive you. Most people thinking a brand is just a logo, and although that’s part of it, branding goes much deeper than that. 
      | #[br] #[br] If your company was a human, what kind of personality would it have? How do you want customers to feel about your company? Is it techy, traditional, bold, luxurious, hipster, etc. These are just a few of the question we ask when designing your brand. 
      | #[br] #[br] Every company is unique and has its own story. We understand that, and take great pride in crafting an identity for your company that you can stand behind.
      | #[br] #[br] Let us help you tell your story.

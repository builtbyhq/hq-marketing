    p(class="text-wide") User experience design (UX design, for short) is how a user feels about a product or company. Is she happy? Impressed? Pleasantly surprised? Or is she frustrated and confused? UX design is important for websites, web applications and mobile apps. #[br] #[br]
      | At it's core, UI/UX design involves planning and executing design in a way that results in achieving users' goals and desired feelingâ€™s associated with that product or task. #[br] #[br]
      | Even though design should be beautiful, it should accomplish goals . That might be to increase conversions, teach a user through on boarding, or guide them to accomplish a task. Every design decision should be informed by goals. #[br] #[br]
      | So how do we design a great user experience? Take a look at our process. In short, it involves research: determining goals, creating user profiles, listing use cases, and mapping all screens. After wireframes and full designs come iteration and testing.

### Working at HQ

A fair question. Many people unfamiliar with design and development are uncomfortable disclosing their budget. They think by giving away their budget, they lose negotiating power and the agencies will inflate prices to meet the max budget. However, it doesn’t work that way with user experience design or development.

You wouldn't be surprised if a car salesman asked how much you want to spend. Sure, your budget can fluctuate and you don’t want to be sold a BMW when a Honda will do just fine, but you don’t want to be sold Hondas when you are looking for a top of the line BMW.

With our business model, our margin is the same whether your budget is $20k or $100k. We charge hourly. On a larger budget project, we will put more time into it, but our margin stays the same (about 30% btw). So we can fill our time with ten $10k projects or one $100k project, and we make the same amount in the same amount of time. You are paying us for our time.

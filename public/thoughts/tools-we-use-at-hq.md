Looking at this list, I’ve realized we use a lot of tools at HQ. When deciding what to use, we follow a few guidelines:
- Try a lot of different tools until we find the best.
- Use the most efficient tool for the job, even if it means adding another tool to the long list.
- If it makes us more productive, it’s probably worth paying for.

### Team

1. Gmail (used as sparsely as possible, but it’s inevitable)
2. Google Calendar
3. Google Drive (replaced Dropbox)
4. Basecamp (project management, client communication)
5. Slack (team communication)

### HR/Business

1. Teamweek (for organizing who’s working on what for how long)
2. Toggl (time tracking)
3. Quickbooks
4. Zenefits (general HR)

### Dev

1. Sublime/Coda
2. Git, BitBucket
3. Trello (usually in place of Basecamp for dev-only projects)
4. Transmit/Filezilla
5. Codekit / Koala
6. RoboMongo
7. Terminal
8. Saucelabs
9. Pixel Perfect (a Chrome extension for front-end dev)
10. Amazon Web Servers
11. Testflight
12. Xcode

### Design

1. TypeKit, H&F (font services)
2. Adobe Creative Cloud (mostly Photoshop and Illustrator)
3. Sketch, Sketch Mirror
4. Invision, Flinto
5. Giant post-its

What do you use? We're always up for trying new tools.
